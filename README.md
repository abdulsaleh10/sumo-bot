# Sumobot

During my software engineering internship at GE Appliances, I participated in their exciting Sumobot competition. Alongside a team of three, we built a robot featuring a microcontroller, two wheels, IR sensors, and line sensors. We added a unique twist: a "scooper" rigged with hinges and a sharp metal plate. Although Sumobot rules typically restrict certain dimensions, they don't limit height. So, we designed our scooper to stay upright at the start and then drop during the match via a clever motor "jerk", giving us a competitive edge without breaking any rules. Our goal was to outmaneuver and push the opposing bot out of the ring. Through agile development, we tackled design challenges and coded our way to victory with Byte-Basher, our champion Sumobot.
